# DataVisualization

Data Visualization using D3 library.

PokeVis shows pokemon attributes for all pokemons from generation 1 to generation 6.

NLPVisualize visualizes the dataset of Hillary's email collaboration. The dataset was gathered from Kaggle. The dashboard displays the sentiment analysis for the emails sent between different people in a 4 year period. Sentiment analysis was done using textblob, a python tool for natural language processing.

PivotPaths is an attempt to recreate Marian Dörk's PivotPaths using an academic dataset gathered from Aminer's Open Academic Graph. Instead of making API calls, we preprocess the data using python locally and use local json files to display data. We've added a feature of random search on the search page to implement the true meaning of "strolling".
